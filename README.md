# ShinyMas Translation Tool v2 (rewrite)

## Features
- Tries to emulate the game font (at least the english one anyways) for best accuracy when doing adding line breaks
- Red line as general guide
- Text turns red when over the red guideline
- Yellow marker (sidebar) for untranslated lines
- Automatically translates known names without affecting the actual out
- Allows user to change name translations without affecting the actual output
- Dark Mode! üòÅ

## Todo
- Custom BG for choice menus

## Working Copy
- [Working copy over at my site](http://ein.rf.gd/smth2)
- **NOTE:** working copy has google analytics running in the background, so if you don't want that, it might be better to try and build the app yourself, as a bonus, you will be able to use it locally
- **NOTE:** working copy might not be up to date with the repo

## Building
- You might also want to remove the analytics dependencies under vite.config.ts
```
git clone https://github.com/Einjerjar/shinymas-translation-tool-v2
cd shinymas-translation-tool-v2
npm i
npm run build
```
